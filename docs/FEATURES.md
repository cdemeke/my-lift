## Workout Features

### Custom Workout Builder
**Location:** Workout → Create Workout

Build personalized workouts from scratch with full control over every detail:
- Name your workout and assign a target muscle group
- Add exercises from a library of 40+ common movements
- Create custom exercises if yours isn't listed
- Configure sets, rep ranges (3-5 to 15-25+), and rest times per exercise
- Reorder exercises via drag-and-drop
- Save as a reusable template for future sessions
- Real-time stats show total exercises, sets, and estimated duration

**Why it's helpful:** Every lifter has unique goals. The builder lets you create exactly the workout you need rather than forcing you into a one-size-fits-all program.

---

### Workout Templates Library
**Location:** Workout → Browse Templates

Pre-built workout programs ready to use immediately:
- **Popular:** Push/Pull/Legs, Upper/Lower, 5x5 Strength
- **Strength-focused:** Powerlifting style, heavy compound movements
- **Hypertrophy:** Higher volume programs for muscle growth
- **Beginner-friendly:** Full body routines with clear progression

Each template shows exercises, target muscles, and estimated duration. Start a template directly or customize it to match your equipment and preferences.

**Why it's helpful:** Not everyone wants to build from scratch. Templates give proven programs you can start today, while still allowing customization.

---

### Superset & Advanced Set Types
**Location:** During workout logging

Support for advanced training techniques:
- **Supersets:** Pair exercises back-to-back with no rest
- **Drop Sets:** Reduce weight and continue for metabolic stress
- **Giant Sets:** 3+ exercises in sequence
- **Rest-Pause:** Brief mid-set rest for additional reps
- **Cluster Sets:** Pauses within a set
- **AMRAP:** As many reps as possible indicator

Visual indicators show grouped exercises with color-coded connectors. Set type badges make it clear what technique you're using.

**Why it's helpful:** Advanced techniques are essential for breaking plateaus. The app tracks them properly instead of forcing workarounds.

---

### RPE/RIR Tracking
**Location:** During workout logging

Track effort level for each set:
- **RPE (Rate of Perceived Exertion):** 6-10 scale with descriptions
- **RIR (Reps In Reserve):** How many reps you had left
- Toggle between RPE and RIR based on preference
- Color-coded visual feedback (green to red)
- Quick-select chips for fast logging

**Why it's helpful:** Volume and weight don't tell the whole story. RPE/RIR reveals how hard you're actually working, enabling smarter programming adjustments.

---

## Tracking Features

### Body Measurements Tracking
**Location:** Progress → Measurements

Track 11 key body measurements over time:
- **Upper body:** Neck, Shoulders, Chest, Left/Right Arm

- **Lower body:** Left/Right Thigh, Left/Right Calf

Features include:
- Toggle between inches and centimeters
- Date-stamped entries with optional notes
- Progress comparison showing change from previous measurement
- Visual history of all entries
- Easy-to-use input form with measurement guidance

**Why it's helpful:** The scale doesn't tell the whole story. Measurements reveal muscle gain even when weight stays the same, and track exactly where you're making progress.

---

### Progress Photos
**Location:** Progress → Photos

Visual documentation of your fitness journey:
- Capture front, side, and back photos in each entry
- Use camera or import from gallery
- Date-stamped entries with optional weight and notes
- **Side-by-side comparison mode** to see transformation over time
- Full-screen viewing with pinch-to-zoom
- Weight change statistics when comparing photos

**Why it's helpful:** Sometimes the scale and measurements don't capture the visual changes. Progress photos show the actual transformation you're achieving.

---

### Weight Tracking with Trend Smoothing
**Location:** Progress → Weight

Smart weight tracking that cuts through daily fluctuations:
- Log daily weights with date and optional notes
- **Exponential moving average trend line** shows true progress
- Toggle between pounds and kilograms
- Set and track toward a goal weight
- Color-coded progress indicators (+/- from previous)
- Visual chart with actual points and smoothed trend

**Why it's helpful:** Daily weight fluctuates due to water, food, and timing. The trend line shows your real direction without the noise of day-to-day changes.

---

## AI Coach Features

**Why it's helpful:** When you're mid-workout with sweaty hands or holding weights, voice input lets you ask questions without needing to type.

---

### Rest Timer with Auto-start
**Location:** During active workout

Intelligent rest timer that starts automatically after logging each set:
- **Auto-start:** Timer begins immediately after completing a set
- **Customizable rest times by exercise type:**
  - Compound exercises (Squat, Bench, Deadlift): 2-3 minutes
  - Isolation exercises (Curls, Extensions): 60-90 seconds
  - Abs/Core work: 30-45 seconds
- **Quick presets:** Strength (3-5 min), Hypertrophy (60-90s), Endurance (30-45s)
- **Time adjustment buttons:** +/- 15s and 30s during rest
- **Visual countdown:** Large display with progress ring
- **Haptic feedback:** Vibrates when timer completes
- **Skip option:** End rest early when ready

**Why it's helpful:** Consistent rest periods optimize training. Auto-start means you never forget to time your rest, and exercise-specific durations ensure optimal recovery for each movement type.

---

### Rep Tempo Tracking
**Location:** During active workout → Tempo button

Control the speed of each rep phase with tempo notation (Eccentric-Pause-Concentric-Pause):
- **Standard notation:** 3-1-2-0 means 3s lowering, 1s pause at bottom, 2s lifting, 0s pause at top
- **Visual phase display:** Shows each phase with color coding
- **Per-set tracking:** Tempo is logged with each set
- **Quick presets:**
  - Standard (2-0-1-0): Normal training tempo
  - Controlled (3-1-2-0): Focus on mind-muscle connection
  - Explosive (2-0-1-0): Power development
  - Slow Eccentric (4-1-1-0): Muscle damage focus
  - Paused (2-2-1-1): Eliminate momentum
  - Time Under Tension (4-2-4-2): Maximum hypertrophy
- **Total time calculator:** Shows seconds per rep

**Why it's helpful:** Tempo training unlocks new stimulus for muscle growth. Tracking tempo ensures you're executing the technique you intended and can progressively overload through time under tension.

---

### Workout Notes
**Location:** Active workout → Notes icon (top right)

Add notes to your workouts and individual sets:
- **Workout-level notes:** General observations about the session
- **Set-level notes:** Quick notes on specific sets (form cues, felt heavy, etc.)
- **Timestamped entries:** See when each note was added
- **Edit and delete:** Modify notes anytime during workout
- **Visual indicators:** Badge shows note count in app bar
- **Quick add:** Tap to expand note input, type, done

**Why it's helpful:** Notes capture context that numbers can't. "Shoulder felt tight" or "New PR after deload" helps you understand patterns and make better training decisions later.
